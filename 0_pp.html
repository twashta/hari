          </div>
          <h3>Priciples:</h3>
          <p>Skill-Ed  as the name itself suggests is a course that teaches skills and processes. Here we try to master skills and understand processes instead of creating any single products altho products/ prototypes are a representation of our command on processes, each week brings new skills to master and challenges to deal with. Objective of all this is to orient students to an array of skills and teach them basics so they can get into depth of nay skills by themselves without any external assistance.
            Initial things I found out after joining this course as a student is to not overthink and start thinking from basics, fundamentals or first principles .Usually our brain complicates things without us being aware.
            Focus on the thing right in-front of  us instead of worrying about future challenges. The goal is to understand processes by heart and learn skills, its a journey of self growth and progress, what students become after spending just a few weeks in the course is the Product(Core Objective) not just the stuff they’re trying to make.
          </p>
          <h3>Practices:</h3>
          <p>In order to achieve core objective of this course students must become instructors by the end of it. This is the most important practice which students have to follow through. For this very reason every student must document all of processes, steps, instructions, work, output as well as their shortcomings and mistakes so that next batch of  future students can see and learn from their documentations. Objective of this is to make students  observant, mindful, thoughtful, deliberate and  make them understand value of giving back to community of creators and makers. This does not mean that they can’t make mistakes, its the other way around the more mistakes they make the better, but they still have to document it all so that others can see, learn and find how to avoid making same mistakes, or if they are stuck somewhere then how to troubleshoot, debug or rebuild it. This basically is a way of showing gratitude to the lineage of creators and makers who came before us and documented all processes, as a result of which  things are relatively simpler for us to learn and  to master.</p>
